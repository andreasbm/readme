## Templates

If you have come this far you are probably interested to figure out how to use README templates. This library comes with a set of pre-defined templates to make your readme awesome, but you can of course create your own. More about that later, let's not get ahead of our self just yet.

### Title

Let's start with the title template. To generate the title you write `{{ template:title }}` in your blueprint. When you run the `readme` command the template will generate the following:

[[ template:title ]]

The important thing to note here is that the template automatically reads your `package.json` file and inserts the `name` from the package.

```json
{
  "name": "[[ pkg.name ]]"
}
```

That's cool. Let's go through some of the other built-in templates you might want to add.

### Logo

The logo template adds a logo to your readme and looks like this:

[[ template:logo ]]

Use the placeholder `{{ template:logo }}` to stamp it. You will need to add the `logo` field to your `blueprint.json`. The logo field requires an `src` field. Optionally you can provide values for `width`, `height` and `alt`. Below is an example on how to add the data for the logo template.

```json
{
  "logo": {
    "src": "[[ logo.src ]]",
    "width": "[[ logo.width ]]"
  }
}
```

### Badges

The badges template adds badges to your readme and looks like this:

[[ template:badges ]]

Use the `{{ template:badges }}` placeholder to stamp it. You will need to add the data about how the badges should be generated. For that you can extend the `ids` property in your `blueprint.json` and add the `npm` and `github` ids (both are optional). If you want to add your own badges you can use the `badges` field.

```json
{
  "ids": {
    "github": "[[ ids.github ]]",
    "npm": "[[ ids.npm ]]"
  },
  "badges": [
    {
      "alt": "Custom badge",
      "url": "https://github.com/badges/shields",
      "img": "https://img.shields.io/badge/custom-badge-f39f37.svg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Description

The description template adds a description to your readme and looks like this:

[[ template:description ]]

Use the `{{ template:description }}` placeholder to stamp it. To use this template you are required to add the field `description` to your `package.json` file. Optionally you can also add the fields `text` and `demo` in your `blueprint.json` file which will be presented below the description.

// package.json

```json
{
  "description": "[[ pkg.description ]]"
}
```

// blueprint.json

```json
{
  "text": "[[ text ]]"
}
```

### Table of Contents

The table of contents template adds a table of contents and looks like this:

[[ template:toc ]]

Use the `{{ template:toc }}` placeholder to stamp it. It has been scientifically proven that this template will save you approximately 392.3 hours during your life-time. Seriously.

### Contributors

The contributors template adds the list of contributors and looks like this:

[[ template:contributors ]]

Use the `{{ template:contributors }}` placeholder to stamp it. To use this template your are required to add the `contributors` array to your `package.json` file like this. Only the `name` field is required.

```json
{
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "Andreas Mehlsen",
      "email": "hello@example.com",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen",
      "img": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6267397?s=460&v=4",
      "info": [
        "ðŸ”¥"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "You?",
      "img": "https://joeschmoe.io/api/v1/random",
      "url": "https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

Take note of the `info` array. That one is really exciting! Here you can add lines describing the contributors - for example the role of accomplishments. Take a look [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for more inspiration of what you could put into the info array.

### License

The license template adds a license section and looks like this:

[[ template:license ]]

Use the `{{ template:license }}` placeholder to stamp it. To use this template you are required to add the `license` field to your `package.json` file like this.

```json
{
  "license": "[[ license ]]"
}
```
